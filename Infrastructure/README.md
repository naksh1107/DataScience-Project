In this section, we conduct a comprehensive infrastructure analysis focused on coworking and office spaces. The process begins with data gathering through a scraping file, followed by data cleaning and transformation using a transforming file. The final step involves analyzing the cleaned data, as detailed in the analysis file. The key findings are summarized in two analysis files: one dedicated to Coworking Spaces and the other to Office Spaces.
