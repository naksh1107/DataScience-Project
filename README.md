# DataScience-Project
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of office spaces and the availability of talent in two major Indian cities, Bangalore and Hyderabad. By examining various datasets, we explore the distribution of coworking spaces, the demand for different types of office infrastructure, and the pool of skilled professionals in these cities. The insights derived from this analysis are intended to assist companies in making informed decisions regarding office expansion, location selection, and talent acquisition strategies.
